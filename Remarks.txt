EnvSettings is an optional class module you might use to store environment-specific settings (like API URL and token) in a neat, object-oriented way.

Why use an EnvSettings class?
You keep related information together (e.g., API endpoint, token, etc. for each environment).
Your code is clearer and easier to maintain.
It’s especially useful if you have many environment-specific parameters.
How to Create the EnvSettings Class
In the VBA editor:

Insert > Class Module
Rename it to EnvSettings (in the Properties window, bottom left).
Paste this code in the EnvSettings class:

vba

Copy
' EnvSettings.cls
Option Explicit

Private pApiUrl As String
Private pApiToken As String

Public Property Get ApiUrl() As String
    ApiUrl = pApiUrl
End Property
Public Property Let ApiUrl(Value As String)
    pApiUrl = Value
End Property

Public Property Get ApiToken() As String
    ApiToken = pApiToken
End Property
Public Property Let ApiToken(Value As String)
    pApiToken = Value
End Property
You can add more properties if you need more configuration per environment.

How to Use EnvSettings in Your Modules
In modConfig for example:

vba

Copy
Dim Envs As Object ' Scripting.Dictionary

Sub InitEnvs()
    Set Envs = CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary")

    Dim dev As New EnvSettings
    dev.ApiUrl = "https://dev-api.example.com/api/save"
    dev.ApiToken = "dev-token-here"

    Dim uat As New EnvSettings
    uat.ApiUrl = "https://uat-api.example.com/api/save"
    uat.ApiToken = "uat-token-here"

    Envs.Add "DEV", dev
    Envs.Add "UAT", uat
End Sub

Function GetEnvSettings(env As String) As EnvSettings
    If Envs Is Nothing Then InitEnvs
    Set GetEnvSettings = Envs(env)
End Function
Is It Required?
No, it’s not required.
If you want to keep things simple, you can just use a Type or a Dictionary instead.
But using a class makes the code more robust and readable, especially as your settings grow.

Class Module	Purpose	Required?
EnvSettings	Store env-specific configuration	Optional
If you want a full copy-paste version of all code using the class, let me know!
You can also skip the class and just use a Type or Dictionary if you prefer simplicity.
